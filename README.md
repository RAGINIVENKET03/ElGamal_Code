# ElGamal Cryptography

ElGamal cryptography is a public-key encryption scheme based on discrete logarithms. It uses key pairs for secure data exchange and randomness for unique ciphertexts. Suitable for encrypting small data, ElGamalâ€™s security depends on strong key and parameter choices.

## Features

- Public-key encryption and decryption  
- Randomized ciphertext for each encryption  
- Based on the discrete logarithm problem  
- Useful for secure key exchange and digital signatures
